# NetCore.WindowsServiceHost

This is just a proof of concept.
You shouldn't use it in any production environment yet.
All the details might be provided later (sorry if not).
If you need to host .Net Core app as a Windows Service right away consider using [DotNetCore.WindowsService](https://github.com/PeterKottas/DotNetCore.WindowsService")
